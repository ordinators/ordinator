- [ ] UX is clear and error messages are helpful

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator init https://github.com/yourname/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
# Clones the repo to ~/.dotfiles, sets up config, ready for apply
ordinator init https://github.com/yourname/dotfiles.git
# Clones the repo to the current directory by default
```

### 4.4 Auto-Generated README with Quick-Install & Secrets Instructions
**Priority:** Medium

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# After ordinator init, repo contains README.md with:
# - Install path
# - Quick-start shell snippet
# - Profile/usage info
# - AGE key warning and path
# - Links to Ordinator project and docs
```

### 4.5 Profile-Specific File Storage and Add Command Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.1, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Enhance `ordinator add` to support profile-specific file storage
- [ ] When adding a file with `--profile`, store it in `files/<profile>/` subdirectory
- [ ] Update config to track the correct source file for each profile
- [ ] Ensure symlinking logic uses the correct profile-specific file
- [ ] Update documentation and usage examples

**Tests:**
- [ ] Adding the same file to multiple profiles stores separate copies
- [ ] Applying a profile symlinks the correct version for that profile
- [ ] No accidental overwrites between profiles
- [ ] Backward compatibility for existing flat file structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator add ~/.zshrc --profile work
# stores as files/work/.zshrc

ordinator add ~/.zshrc --profile laptop
# stores as files/laptop/.zshrc

ordinator apply --profile work
# symlinks files/work/.zshrc to ~/.zshrc
```

### 4.6 Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.2, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `ordinator uninstall` command
- [ ] Remove all symlinks created by Ordinator for selected profile(s)
- [ ] Optionally restore original files from backups
- [ ] Support dry-run and force options
- [ ] Prompt for config and repo cleanup (optional)
- [ ] Update documentation and usage examples

**Backups Details:**
- Backups are created during `ordinator apply` if a file already exists at the target location and backups are enabled (`create_backups = true`).
- The original file is moved to a backup location (e.g., `~/.zshrc.ordinator.bak`) before the symlink is created.
- Backups are typically stored in the same directory as the original file, with a `.ordinator.bak` or similar suffix.
- During uninstall/restore, Ordinator will remove the symlink and, if a backup exists, move it back to the original location.
- If multiple backups exist, the most recent is restored (or the user is prompted).
- If backups are disabled, uninstall will only remove symlinks and not restore originals.
- If no backup exists, the symlink is removed and the user is warned that the original file cannot be restored.
- Best practice: Always enable backups to ensure safe restoration of original files.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Uninstall removes all symlinks for a profile
- [ ] Backups are restored if requested
- [ ] No data loss if backups are missing
- [ ] Dry-run shows correct actions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator uninstall --profile work --restore-backups
# Removes all symlinks for 'work' profile and restores backups if available
```
