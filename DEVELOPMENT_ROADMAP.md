**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Support `ordinator init --repo <repo-url> [target-dir]`, with `[target-dir]` as a positional argument (defaulting to the current directory if omitted, matching `git clone` behavior). The repository URL is only provided via the `--repo` flag, not as a positional argument.
- [ ] Add `--repo` flag to `ordinator init` for remote cloning (deprecated in favor of positional argument, but may be supported for backward compatibility)
- [ ] Prompt for or accept target directory
- [ ] Clone the specified repository safely (with overwrite checks)
- [ ] Set up configuration and profiles from the cloned repo
- [ ] Optionally support branch/tag selection
- [ ] Integrate with existing bootstrap and apply flows
- [ ] Enhance `ordinator push` to accept a `--repo` or `--remote` URL, set the remote if not already configured, and push to that remote. This reduces reliance on a pre-installed git executable and improves onboarding for new users.
- [ ] Add interactive prompts for repository URL input and directory selection
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for cloning and setup operations
- [ ] Enhance error messages for network issues and authentication problems
- [ ] Add autocompletion for repository URLs and directory paths

**Tests:**

- [ ] Autocompletion works for repository URLs and paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator init https://github.com/yourname/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
# Clones the repo to ~/.dotfiles, sets up config, ready for apply
ordinator init https://github.com/yourname/dotfiles.git
# Clones the repo to the current directory by default
# Interactive prompts guide user through setup
# Progress indicators show cloning status
```

**Dependencies:** 2.1, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

- [ ] Add colorized output for file operations and profile status

**Tests:**
- [ ] Adding the same file to multiple profiles stores separate copies
- [ ] Applying a profile symlinks the correct version for that profile
- [ ] No accidental overwrites between profiles
- [ ] Backward compatibility for existing flat file structure
- [ ] Interactive prompts work for profile selection
- [ ] Progress indicators display during file operations
- [ ] Error handling works for file conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

# stores as files/work/.zshrc

ordinator add ~/.zshrc --profile laptop
# stores as files/laptop/.zshrc

ordinator apply --profile work
# symlinks files/work/.zshrc to ~/.zshrc
# Interactive prompts guide profile selection
# Progress indicators show file operations
```

### 4.6 Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.2, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `ordinator uninstall` command
- [ ] Remove all symlinks created by Ordinator for selected profile(s)
- [ ] Optionally restore original files from backups
- [ ] Support dry-run and force options
- [ ] Prompt for config and repo cleanup (optional)
- [ ] Update documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Add interactive confirmation for destructive operations
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for backup restoration
- [ ] Add colorized output for showing what will be removed/restored
- [ ] Enhance dry-run mode with detailed preview of uninstall actions

**Backups Details:**
- Backups are created during `ordinator apply` if a file already exists at the target location and backups are enabled (`create_backups = true`).
- The original file is moved to a backup location (e.g., `~/.zshrc.ordinator.bak`) before the symlink is created.
- Backups are typically stored in the same directory as the original file, with a `.ordinator.bak` or similar suffix.
- During uninstall/restore, Ordinator will remove the symlink and, if a backup exists, move it back to the original location.
- If multiple backups exist, the most recent is restored (or the user is prompted).
- If backups are disabled, uninstall will only remove symlinks and not restore originals.
- If no backup exists, the symlink is removed and the user is warned that the original file cannot be restored.
- Best practice: Always enable backups to ensure safe restoration of original files.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Uninstall removes all symlinks for a profile
- [ ] Backups are restored if requested
- [ ] No data loss if backups are missing
- [ ] Dry-run shows correct actions
- [ ] Interactive confirmations work for destructive operations
- [ ] Progress indicators display during restoration
- [ ] Colorized output shows removal/restoration preview

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator uninstall --profile work --restore-backups
# Removes all symlinks for 'work' profile and restores backups if available
# Interactive prompts confirm destructive operations
# Progress indicators show restoration status
# Colorized output previews actions
```
