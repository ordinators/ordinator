```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.4 (Auto-Generated README with Remote URL Warning System) and prepares for Phase 4.5 (Profile-Specific File Storage).

### 4.5 Profile-Specific File Storage and Add Command Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.1, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

ordinator apply --profile work
# symlinks files/work/.zshrc to ~/.zshrc
# Interactive prompts guide profile selection
# Progress indicators show file operations
# README profile section is always accurate to ordinator.toml
# No mention of profiles that do not exist in the config
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.5 (Profile-Specific File Storage and Add Command Enhancement) and prepares for Phase 4.6 (Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration).

### 4.6 Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.2, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement `ordinator uninstall` command
- [x] Remove all symlinks created by Ordinator for selected profile(s)
- [x] Optionally restore original files from backups
- [x] Support dry-run and force options
- [x] Prompt for config and repo cleanup (optional)
- [x] Update documentation and usage examples
- [x] Add interactive confirmation for destructive operations
- [x] Implement progress indicators for backup restoration
- [x] Add colorized output for showing what will be removed/restored
- [x] Enhance dry-run mode with detailed preview of uninstall actions

**Backups Details:**
- Backups are created during `ordinator apply` if a file already exists at the target location and backups are enabled (`create_backups = true`).
- The original file is moved to a backup location (e.g., `~/.zshrc.ordinator.bak`) before the symlink is created.
- Backups are typically stored in the same directory as the original file, with a `.ordinator.bak` or similar suffix.
- During uninstall/restore, Ordinator will remove the symlink and, if a backup exists, move it back to the original location.
- If multiple backups exist, the most recent is restored (or the user is prompted).
- If backups are disabled, uninstall will only remove symlinks and not restore originals.
- If no backup exists, the symlink is removed and the user is warned that the original file cannot be restored.
- Best practice: Always enable backups to ensure safe restoration of original files.

**Tests:**
- [x] Uninstall removes all symlinks for a profile
- [x] Backups are restored if requested
- [x] No data loss if backups are missing
- [x] Dry-run shows correct actions
- [x] Interactive confirmations work for destructive operations
- [x] Progress indicators display during restoration
- [x] Colorized output shows removal/restoration preview

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator uninstall --profile work --restore-backups
# Removes all symlinks for 'work' profile and restores backups if available
# Interactive prompts confirm destructive operations
# Progress indicators show restoration status
# Colorized output previews actions
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.6 (Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration) and prepares for Phase 4.7 (Secrets Workflow Review and Enhancement).

### 4.7 Secrets Workflow Review and Enhancement

# 2. Encrypts in memory
# 3. Saves only encrypted version to repository
# 4. Tracks encrypted file in config
# 5. Never stores plaintext

# Bulk operations for efficiency
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Loops through all files in secrets array and re-encrypts them
```

**Tests:**
- [x] `ordinator secrets add` never stores plaintext in repository
- [x] Encrypted files are properly tracked in configuration
- [x] Commit scanning detects plaintext secrets effectively
- [x] Interactive prompts guide users through secure workflow
- [x] Error messages are clear about security implications
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# New secure workflow
ordinator secrets add ~/.ssh/config --profile work
# Result: Only encrypted file stored in repository

# Bulk operations
ordinator add --all --profile work
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Result: All tracked files updated without manual path specification

# Validation
ordinator commit -m "Add sensitive files"
# Blocks commit if plaintext secrets detected
# Provides clear guidance on how to fix
```

**Major Improvements Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Array Management**: Added dedicated `secrets` array in profile configuration for direct source paths
- ‚úÖ **Bulk Operations**: Implemented `--all` flag for both `add` and `secrets add` commands
- ‚úÖ **CLI Enhancement**: Made path argument optional when using `--all` flag

- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflows
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for both scenarios
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new behavior
- [x] Update README quick start section to remove `ordinator secrets setup` requirement since apply will handle AGE key setup through prompts

**Scenario 1 - New Key Generation:**
```
‚ùå AGE key not found for profile 'work'
Would you like to generate a new AGE key? (y/N): y
‚úÖ AGE key generated successfully
   Key stored at: ~/.config/ordinator/age/work.txt
   SOPS config created at: ~/.config/ordinator/.sops.work.yaml
```

**Scenario 2 - Import Existing Key:**
```
‚ùå AGE key not found for profile 'work'
Do you have an existing AGE key to import? (y/N): y
Please paste your AGE private key (it will be stored securely):
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1abc123...
‚úÖ AGE key imported successfully
   Key stored at: ~/.config/ordinator/age/work.txt
   SOPS config created at: ~/.config/ordinator/.sops.work.yaml
```

**Tests:**
- [x] Configuration structs properly serialize/deserialize `created_on` field in profiles
- [x] Configuration structs properly serialize/deserialize `key_rotation_interval_days` field in secrets
- [x] Age key creation sets `created_on` timestamp in the correct profile
- [x] Age key rotation updates `created_on` timestamp in the correct profile
- [x] Interval checking works correctly for different rotation periods (30, 90, 180, 365 days)
- [x] Warning prompts appear when key age exceeds configured interval
- [x] No warning appears when key age is within configured interval
- [x] Backward compatibility: missing `created_on` falls back to file creation time
- [x] Backward compatibility: missing `key_rotation_interval_days` uses default behavior (no warnings)
- [x] CLI commands check key age on secrets/age operations
- [x] Integration tests cover complete key rotation workflow
- [x] Missing AGE key is detected during apply
- [x] Interactive prompts work for both scenarios
- [x] New key generation works correctly
- [x] Existing key import validates key format
- [x] Imported keys are stored securely with proper permissions

- [x] Integration tests cover both scenarios
- [x] CLI tests verify prompting behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# Scenario 1: First-time setup (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects missing age key and prompts for setup
# Guides user through new key generation or key import
# Continues with apply process after key setup

# Scenario 2: Multi-machine replication (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects missing age key and prompts for setup
# Allows importing existing key from another machine
# Validates key format and stores securely

# Error handling (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Handles invalid key format gracefully
# Provides clear error messages and recovery guidance
# Allows skipping secrets with --skip-secrets flag

# Key mismatch handling (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects when encrypted secrets can't be decrypted with current key
# Provides options: skip file, cancel operation, or import correct key
# Continues with other apply operations even if some secrets can't be decrypted
```

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Key rotation tracking and warnings are implemented
- ‚úÖ Age key creation with timestamps is implemented
- ‚úÖ Interactive age key setup during apply is implemented
- ‚úÖ Missing key detection during apply is implemented
- ‚úÖ Key import functionality is implemented

**Additional Tasks for Key Mismatch Handling:**
- [x] Detect when new age key cannot decrypt existing encrypted secrets
- [x] Implement graceful error handling for key mismatch scenarios
- [x] Provide clear user guidance when decryption fails due to key mismatch
- [x] Add option to skip secrets decryption and continue with other apply operations
- [x] Show list of files that cannot be decrypted with the new key
- [x] Add warning messages explaining the key mismatch issue
- [x] Implement `--skip-secrets` flag handling in apply command
- [x] Add tests for key mismatch detection and graceful degradation
- [x] Update documentation to explain key mismatch scenarios and recovery options

**Key Mismatch Scenario:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Found encrypted secrets that were created with a different key
   The following files cannot be decrypted with the new key:
   - secrets/config.yaml
   - secrets/credentials.json
   
   To decrypt these secrets, you need the original key.
   The apply will continue without decrypting these secrets.
   
   To fix this:
   1. Get the original age key
   2. Import it using: ordinator age setup --profile work
   3. Re-apply: ordinator apply --profile work
   
   Or continue without secrets: ordinator apply --profile work --skip-secrets
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.8 (AGE Key Prompting During Apply) with all core functionality implemented. The interactive age key setup, key mismatch handling, and `--skip-secrets` flag are all working. Documentation has been updated to explain the new flows. This prepares for Phase 4.9 (Enhanced README with Homebrew Packages Section).

# - Separate Homebrew packages section with formulae links
# - Both sections use collapsible sections for clean organization

# Without Homebrew packages in config
ordinator readme default
# Generates README without Homebrew packages section
# Enhanced profiles section still shows files and directories

# Enhanced Homebrew export with separate formulas and casks
ordinator brew export --profile work
# Calls 'brew leaves -r' for formulas (user-installed only)
# Calls 'brew list --cask' for casks
# Stores formulas and casks separately in TOML
# Breaking change: Replaces existing homebrew_packages field

# Enhanced Homebrew install during apply
ordinator apply --profile work
# Installs both formulas and casks from profile
# Uses separate installation commands for each type

# When Homebrew packages are added/removed from profiles
ordinator brew export --profile work
ordinator readme default
# README automatically updates to reflect new packages in work profile
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.9 (Enhanced README with Homebrew Packages Section) and prepares for Phase 4.10 (Hash-Based Filename Mapping).

### 4.10 Hash-Based Filename Mapping
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.1, 3.1, 4.7  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement hash-based filename generation for file collision prevention
- [ ] Add hash generation function using SHA-256 truncated to 6 characters
- [ ] Implement file mapping system in TOML configuration
- [ ] Update `ordinator watch` to use hash-based filenames
- [ ] Update `ordinator secrets watch` to use hash-based filenames
- [ ] Modify file storage to use `files/<profile>/<hash>_<filename>` pattern
- [ ] Add `file_mappings` field to `ProfileConfig` structure
- [ ] Update `ordinator add` to work with hash-based filenames
- [ ] Update `ordinator secrets add` to work with hash-based filenames
- [ ] Modify apply command to use mappings for correct symlink creation
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility for existing files without hashes
- [ ] Add migration logic for existing repositories
- [ ] Update bulk operations (`--all` flags) to work with mappings
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for hash-based file management
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new file naming system

**Hash Generation:**
```rust
fn generate_file_hash(path: &str) -> String {
    use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(path.as_bytes());
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    format!("{:x}", result)[0..6].to_string()
}
```

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Regular files
ordinator watch ~/.config/app/config.txt --profile work
# Hash: "a1b2c3" -> stores as: files/work/a1b2c3_config.txt
# Mapping: "a1b2c3_config.txt" -> "~/.config/app/config.txt"

ordinator watch ~/Documents/config.txt --profile work
# Hash: "d4e5f6" -> stores as: files/work/d4e5f6_config.txt
# Mapping: "d4e5f6_config.txt" -> "~/Documents/config.txt"

# Secrets
ordinator secrets watch ~/.ssh/config --profile work
# Hash: "9f8e7d" -> stores as: files/work/9f8e7d_config.enc
# Mapping: "9f8e7d_config.enc" -> "~/.ssh/config"
```

**TOML Structure:**
```toml
[profiles.work]
files = ["~/.config/app/config.txt", "~/Documents/config.txt"]
secrets = ["~/.ssh/config", "~/.aws/credentials"]
file_mappings = {
  "a1b2c3_config.txt" = "~/.config/app/config.txt",
  "d4e5f6_config.txt" = "~/Documents/config.txt",
  "9f8e7d_config.enc" = "~/.ssh/config",
  "1a2b3c_credentials.enc" = "~/.aws/credentials"
}
```

**Tests:**
- [ ] Hash generation produces consistent results for same path
- [ ] Different paths produce different hashes
- [ ] File collisions are prevented with hash-based naming
- [ ] `ordinator watch` creates correct hash-based filenames
- [ ] `ordinator secrets watch` creates correct hash-based filenames
- [ ] `ordinator add` updates files with hash-based names
- [ ] `ordinator secrets add` updates encrypted files with hash-based names
- [ ] Apply command creates correct symlinks using mappings
- [ ] Bulk operations work with hash-based file system
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing files
- [ ] Migration handles existing repositories gracefully
- [ ] Error handling works for hash collisions (extremely unlikely)
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# No more filename collisions
ordinator watch ~/.config/app/config.txt --profile work
ordinator watch ~/Documents/config.txt --profile work
# Result: files/work/a1b2c3_config.txt and files/work/d4e5f6_config.txt

# Secrets work with hash-based naming
ordinator secrets watch ~/.ssh/config --profile work
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Result: files/work/9f8e7d_config.enc

# Apply uses mappings correctly
ordinator apply --profile work
# Result: Correct symlinks created using TOML mappings
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No filename collisions**: Hash ensures unique filenames
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic**: Same path always generates same hash
- ‚úÖ **Consistent across machines**: Hash is path-based, not random
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible**: Existing files continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Works for both files and secrets**: Unified approach
- ‚úÖ **Collision resistant**: SHA-256 truncated to 6 chars = 16.7M combinations

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.10 (Hash-Based Filename Mapping) and prepares for Phase 5 (System Commands & Script Generation).
