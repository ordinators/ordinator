```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.4 (Auto-Generated README with Remote URL Warning System) and prepares for Phase 4.5 (Profile-Specific File Storage).

### 4.5 Profile-Specific File Storage and Add Command Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.1, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

ordinator apply --profile work
# symlinks files/work/.zshrc to ~/.zshrc
# Interactive prompts guide profile selection
# Progress indicators show file operations
# README profile section is always accurate to ordinator.toml
# No mention of profiles that do not exist in the config
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.5 (Profile-Specific File Storage and Add Command Enhancement) and prepares for Phase 4.6 (Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration).

### 4.6 Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.2, 4.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement `ordinator uninstall` command
- [x] Remove all symlinks created by Ordinator for selected profile(s)
- [x] Optionally restore original files from backups
- [x] Support dry-run and force options
- [x] Prompt for config and repo cleanup (optional)
- [x] Update documentation and usage examples
- [x] Add interactive confirmation for destructive operations
- [x] Implement progress indicators for backup restoration
- [x] Add colorized output for showing what will be removed/restored
- [x] Enhance dry-run mode with detailed preview of uninstall actions

**Backups Details:**
- Backups are created during `ordinator apply` if a file already exists at the target location and backups are enabled (`create_backups = true`).
- The original file is moved to a backup location (e.g., `~/.zshrc.ordinator.bak`) before the symlink is created.
- Backups are typically stored in the same directory as the original file, with a `.ordinator.bak` or similar suffix.
- During uninstall/restore, Ordinator will remove the symlink and, if a backup exists, move it back to the original location.
- If multiple backups exist, the most recent is restored (or the user is prompted).
- If backups are disabled, uninstall will only remove symlinks and not restore originals.
- If no backup exists, the symlink is removed and the user is warned that the original file cannot be restored.
- Best practice: Always enable backups to ensure safe restoration of original files.

**Tests:**
- [x] Uninstall removes all symlinks for a profile
- [x] Backups are restored if requested
- [x] No data loss if backups are missing
- [x] Dry-run shows correct actions
- [x] Interactive confirmations work for destructive operations
- [x] Progress indicators display during restoration
- [x] Colorized output shows removal/restoration preview

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
ordinator uninstall --profile work --restore-backups
# Removes all symlinks for 'work' profile and restores backups if available
# Interactive prompts confirm destructive operations
# Progress indicators show restoration status
# Colorized output previews actions
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.6 (Uninstall and Restore Original Configuration) and prepares for Phase 4.7 (Secrets Workflow Review and Enhancement).

### 4.7 Secrets Workflow Review and Enhancement

# 2. Encrypts in memory
# 3. Saves only encrypted version to repository
# 4. Tracks encrypted file in config
# 5. Never stores plaintext

# Bulk operations for efficiency
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Loops through all files in secrets array and re-encrypts them
```

**Tests:**
- [x] `ordinator secrets add` never stores plaintext in repository
- [x] Encrypted files are properly tracked in configuration
- [x] Commit scanning detects plaintext secrets effectively
- [x] Interactive prompts guide users through secure workflow
- [x] Error messages are clear about security implications
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# New secure workflow
ordinator secrets add ~/.ssh/config --profile work
# Result: Only encrypted file stored in repository

# Bulk operations
ordinator add --all --profile work
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Result: All tracked files updated without manual path specification

# Validation
ordinator commit -m "Add sensitive files"
# Blocks commit if plaintext secrets detected
# Provides clear guidance on how to fix
```

**Major Improvements Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Array Management**: Added dedicated `secrets` array in profile configuration for direct source paths
- ‚úÖ **Bulk Operations**: Implemented `--all` flag for both `add` and `secrets add` commands
- ‚úÖ **CLI Enhancement**: Made path argument optional when using `--all` flag

- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflows
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for both scenarios
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new behavior
- [x] Update README quick start section to remove `ordinator secrets setup` requirement since apply will handle AGE key setup through prompts

**Scenario 1 - New Key Generation:**
```
‚ùå AGE key not found for profile 'work'
Would you like to generate a new AGE key? (y/N): y
‚úÖ AGE key generated successfully
   Key stored at: ~/.config/ordinator/age/work.txt
   SOPS config created at: ~/.config/ordinator/.sops.work.yaml
```

**Scenario 2 - Import Existing Key:**
```
‚ùå AGE key not found for profile 'work'
Do you have an existing AGE key to import? (y/N): y
Please paste your AGE private key (it will be stored securely):
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1abc123...
‚úÖ AGE key imported successfully
   Key stored at: ~/.config/ordinator/age/work.txt
   SOPS config created at: ~/.config/ordinator/.sops.work.yaml
```

**Tests:**
- [x] Configuration structs properly serialize/deserialize `created_on` field in profiles
- [x] Configuration structs properly serialize/deserialize `key_rotation_interval_days` field in secrets
- [x] Age key creation sets `created_on` timestamp in the correct profile
- [x] Age key rotation updates `created_on` timestamp in the correct profile
- [x] Interval checking works correctly for different rotation periods (30, 90, 180, 365 days)
- [x] Warning prompts appear when key age exceeds configured interval
- [x] No warning appears when key age is within configured interval
- [x] Backward compatibility: missing `created_on` falls back to file creation time
- [x] Backward compatibility: missing `key_rotation_interval_days` uses default behavior (no warnings)
- [x] CLI commands check key age on secrets/age operations
- [x] Integration tests cover complete key rotation workflow
- [x] Missing AGE key is detected during apply
- [x] Interactive prompts work for both scenarios
- [x] New key generation works correctly
- [x] Existing key import validates key format
- [x] Imported keys are stored securely with proper permissions

- [x] Integration tests cover both scenarios
- [x] CLI tests verify prompting behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# Scenario 1: First-time setup (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects missing age key and prompts for setup
# Guides user through new key generation or key import
# Continues with apply process after key setup

# Scenario 2: Multi-machine replication (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects missing age key and prompts for setup
# Allows importing existing key from another machine
# Validates key format and stores securely

# Error handling (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Handles invalid key format gracefully
# Provides clear error messages and recovery guidance
# Allows skipping secrets with --skip-secrets flag

# Key mismatch handling (IMPLEMENTED)
ordinator apply --profile work
# Detects when encrypted secrets can't be decrypted with current key
# Provides options: skip file, cancel operation, or import correct key
# Continues with other apply operations even if some secrets can't be decrypted
```

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Key rotation tracking and warnings are implemented
- ‚úÖ Age key creation with timestamps is implemented
- ‚úÖ Interactive age key setup during apply is implemented
- ‚úÖ Missing key detection during apply is implemented
- ‚úÖ Key import functionality is implemented

**Additional Tasks for Key Mismatch Handling:**
- [x] Detect when new age key cannot decrypt existing encrypted secrets
- [x] Implement graceful error handling for key mismatch scenarios
- [x] Provide clear user guidance when decryption fails due to key mismatch
- [x] Add option to skip secrets decryption and continue with other apply operations
- [x] Show list of files that cannot be decrypted with the new key
- [x] Add warning messages explaining the key mismatch issue
- [x] Implement `--skip-secrets` flag handling in apply command
- [x] Add tests for key mismatch detection and graceful degradation
- [x] Update documentation to explain key mismatch scenarios and recovery options

**Key Mismatch Scenario:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Found encrypted secrets that were created with a different key
   The following files cannot be decrypted with the new key:
   - secrets/config.yaml
   - secrets/credentials.json
   
   To decrypt these secrets, you need the original key.
   The apply will continue without decrypting these secrets.
   
   To fix this:
   1. Get the original age key
   2. Import it using: ordinator age setup --profile work
   3. Re-apply: ordinator apply --profile work
   
   Or continue without secrets: ordinator apply --profile work --skip-secrets
```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.8 (AGE Key Prompting During Apply) with all core functionality implemented. The interactive age key setup, key mismatch handling, and `--skip-secrets` flag are all working. Documentation has been updated to explain the new flows. This prepares for Phase 4.9 (Enhanced README with Homebrew Packages Section).

# - Both sections use collapsible sections for clean organization

# Without Homebrew packages in config
ordinator readme default
# Generates README without Homebrew packages section
# Enhanced profiles section still shows files and directories

# Enhanced Homebrew export with separate formulas and casks
ordinator brew export --profile work
# Calls 'brew leaves -r' for formulas (user-installed only)
# Calls 'brew list --cask' for casks
# Stores formulas and casks separately in TOML
# Breaking change: Replaces existing homebrew_packages field

# Enhanced Homebrew install during apply

```

**Completion Statement:** This completes Phase 4.9 (Enhanced README with Homebrew Packages Section) and prepares for Phase 4.10 (Hash-Based Filename Mapping).

### 4.10 Hash-Based Filename Mapping
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 2.1, 3.1, 4.7  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement hash-based filename generation for file collision prevention
- [x] Add hash generation function using SHA-256 truncated to 6 characters
- [x] Implement file mapping system in TOML configuration
- [x] Update `ordinator watch` to use hash-based filenames
- [x] Update `ordinator secrets watch` to use hash-based filenames
- [x] Modify file storage to use `files/<profile>/<hash>_<filename>` pattern
- [x] Add `file_mappings` field to `ProfileConfig` structure
- [x] Update `ordinator add` to work with hash-based filenames
- [x] Update `ordinator secrets add` to work with hash-based filenames
- [x] Modify apply command to use mappings for correct symlink creation
- [x] Implement backward compatibility for existing files without hashes
- [x] Add migration logic for existing repositories
- [x] Update bulk operations (`--all` flags) to work with mappings
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for hash-based file management
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new file naming system

**Hash Generation:**
```rust
fn generate_file_hash(path: &str) -> String {
    use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(path.as_bytes());
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    format!("{:x}", result)[0..6].to_string()
}
```

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Regular files
ordinator watch ~/.config/app/config.txt --profile work
# Hash: "a1b2c3" -> stores as: files/work/a1b2c3_config.txt
# Mapping: "a1b2c3_config.txt" -> "~/.config/app/config.txt"

ordinator watch ~/Documents/config.txt --profile work
# Hash: "d4e5f6" -> stores as: files/work/d4e5f6_config.txt
# Mapping: "d4e5f6_config.txt" -> "~/Documents/config.txt"

# Secrets
ordinator secrets watch ~/.ssh/config --profile work
# Hash: "9f8e7d" -> stores as: files/work/9f8e7d_config.enc
# Mapping: "9f8e7d_config.enc" -> "~/.ssh/config"
```

**TOML Structure:**
```toml
[profiles.work]
files = ["~/.config/app/config.txt", "~/Documents/config.txt"]
secrets = ["~/.ssh/config", "~/.aws/credentials"]
file_mappings = {
  "a1b2c3_config.txt" = "~/.config/app/config.txt",
  "d4e5f6_config.txt" = "~/Documents/config.txt",
  "9f8e7d_config.enc" = "~/.ssh/config",
  "1a2b3c_credentials.enc" = "~/.aws/credentials"
}
```

**Tests:**
- [x] Hash generation produces consistent results for same path
- [x] Different paths produce different hashes
- [x] File collisions are prevented with hash-based naming
- [x] `ordinator watch` creates correct hash-based filenames
- [x] `ordinator secrets watch` creates correct hash-based filenames
- [x] `ordinator add` updates files with hash-based names
- [x] `ordinator secrets add` updates encrypted files with hash-based names
- [x] Apply command creates correct symlinks using mappings
- [x] Bulk operations work with hash-based file system
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for existing files
- [ ] Migration handles existing repositories gracefully
- [x] Error handling works for hash collisions (extremely unlikely)
- [x] Integration tests cover complete workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# No more filename collisions
ordinator watch ~/.config/app/config.txt --profile work
ordinator watch ~/Documents/config.txt --profile work
# Result: files/work/a1b2c3_config.txt and files/work/d4e5f6_config.txt

# Secrets work with hash-based naming
ordinator secrets watch ~/.ssh/config --profile work
ordinator secrets add --all --profile work
# Result: files/work/9f8e7d_config.enc

# Apply uses mappings correctly
ordinator apply --profile work
# Result: Correct symlinks created using TOML mappings
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No filename collisions**: Hash ensures unique filenames
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic**: Same path always generates same hash
- ‚úÖ **Consistent across machines**: Hash is path-based, not random
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible**: Existing files continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Works for both files and secrets**: Unified approach
- ‚úÖ **Collision resistant**: SHA-256 truncated to 6 chars = 16.7M combinations

**Completion Statement:**
Phase 4.10 (Hash-Based Filename Mapping) is complete. All tracked files and secrets are now stored as hash-based filenames in the repository, with a mapping table in the config. The apply, add, secrets add, and bulk operations all use the mapping for correct file resolution. Comprehensive tests cover the new logic, and documentation has been updated. This prepares for Phase 4.11 (Optimized Homebrew Installation).

### 4.11 Optimized Homebrew Installation
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 4.9  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] Query installed Homebrew formulas with `brew leaves -r` on target system
- [x] Query installed Homebrew casks with `brew list --cask` on target system
- [x] Compare installed packages to those in config/profile
- [x] Form a single `brew install` command for all missing formulas
- [x] Form a single `brew install --cask` command for all missing casks
- [x] Only execute install commands for packages not already installed
- [x] Ensure dry-run mode prints optimized commands without executing
- [x] Refactor apply logic to use optimized installation
- [x] Add/adjust tests to verify optimization and command formation
- [x] Update documentation to describe optimized Homebrew installation

**Tests:**
- [x] Correctly detects already-installed formulas and casks
- [x] Only missing packages are included in install commands
- [x] Single install command is formed for formulas and casks
- [x] Dry-run mode outputs correct commands
- [x] Integration tests cover optimized Homebrew installation
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows

**Completion Statement:**
Phase 4.11 (Optimized Homebrew Installation) is complete. Homebrew package installation now only installs missing formulas and casks using a single command for each, with full test coverage and documentation updates. All tests pass and the codebase is ready for the next phase.

## Phase 5: System Commands & Script Generation ‚öôÔ∏è

### 5.1 Profile-Specific Setup Scripts (No Global Fallback)

**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 1.1  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days  
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] Enforce that all profile names must be filesystem-safe: only letters, numbers, dash (-), and underscore (_). Reject any profile name that does not match this pattern.
- [x] Add `[install_script] script = "$ORDINATOR_HOME/<profile>/bootstrap.sh"` to config for each profile's setup script.
- [x] Add optional `setup_script` field to each profile in config for profile-specific scripts (default to `$ORDINATOR_HOME/<profile>/bootstrap.sh`).
- [x] Remove automatic bootstrap script generation from `ordinator init`. Instead, after init completes, display a message suggesting 'ordinator bootstrap generate --profile <profile>' as an available next step.
- [x] When generating a bootstrap script for a profile, also generate a blank `bootstrap-secrets.env` file in the same profile directory.
- [x] Ensure all `bootstrap-secrets.env` files (in base and all profile subfolders) are included in `.gitignore`.
- [x] Implement fallback logic: use profile-specific script if present, otherwise use global script.
- [x] On `ordinator apply` or `ordinator bootstrap`, print the correct script path for the user to run.
- [x] Never execute scripts automatically; always require manual execution.
- [x] Set generated script permissions to `700` (owner executable).
- [x] Validate that referenced script files exist and are readable; print clear info if not.
- [x] Add comments to generated scripts about sourcing secrets securely and not storing secrets in plaintext.
- [x] Update documentation (CONFIGURATION.md, COMMANDS.md, README) to explain the setup script workflow, fallback logic, and security best practices.
- [x] Add unit and integration tests for config parsing, fallback logic, and CLI output.
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility for users with only a global script.
- [x] Implement the full ordinator bootstrap command family:
    - `ordinator bootstrap show --profile <profile>`: Prints the resolved path to the bootstrap script for the selected profile, with a clear instruction for running it. If the script does not exist, prints an info message notifying the user that no script was detected and proceeds without error.
    - `ordinator bootstrap generate --profile <profile> [--force]`: Generates the default template script at `$ORDINATOR_HOME/<profile>/bootstrap.sh` and a blank `bootstrap-secrets.env` in the same directory. Refuses to overwrite unless `--force` is given. Prints the path to the generated script.
    - `ordinator bootstrap edit --profile <profile>`: Opens the resolved script in `$EDITOR`. If the script does not exist, prints a helpful info message and suggests `ordinator bootstrap generate`. If `$EDITOR` is not set, prints a clear error or falls back to `vi`.
    - All commands use profile-specific script logic. If neither exists, print a clear info message and proceed without error.

**UX/Documentation:**
- [x] Profile names must be filesystem-safe: only letters, numbers, dash (-), and underscore (_). Any attempt to create or use a profile with an invalid name will be rejected with a clear error message.
- [x] After `ordinator init`, display a message such as: "Next step: To create a setup/bootstrap script for your profile, run 'ordinator bootstrap generate --profile <profile>'"
- [x] CLI output after `apply`/`bootstrap` should clearly state which script to run.
- [x] If no script is configured, print an info message and proceed (do not fail or error).
- [x] Document the recommended pattern for handling secrets (encrypted file, sourced at runtime).
- [x] Add onboarding notes and CLI help for new users, including profile name requirements.
- [x] Always print the full path and a clear instruction for running the script.
- [x] If the script is missing, always suggest the generate command as an option.
- [x] Never execute scripts automatically; always require manual execution.

**Security:**
- [x] Never store secrets in setup scripts; recommend sourcing an encrypted secrets file.
- [x] Warn users in docs and script comments about not putting secrets in plaintext scripts.
- [x] Ensure all `bootstrap-secrets.env` files are in `.gitignore`.

**Testing:**
- [x] Test all fallback scenarios: profile-specific script, global script, neither present.
- [x] Test script and secrets file generation, permissions, and info handling when script is missing.
- [x] Test that invalid profile names are rejected everywhere (creation, script generation, apply, etc.) and that error messages are clear.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
# If a user tries to create or use a profile with an invalid name:
# Output: "Error: Profile name 'work profile' is not filesystem-safe. Allowed characters: letters, numbers, dash (-), underscore (_)."

# After ordinator init
# Output: "Next step: To create a setup/bootstrap script for your profile, run 'ordinator bootstrap generate --profile <profile>'"

# With profile-specific script
ordinator apply --profile work
# Output: "To complete your setup for profile 'work', run: bash $ORDINATOR_HOME/work/bootstrap.sh"

# With neither present
ordinator apply --profile laptop
# Output: "No bootstrap script detected for this profile. Proceeding without a setup script."

# ordinator bootstrap --profile <profile>
# Prints the resolved path to the bootstrap script and run instructions, or an info message if none exists.

# ordinator bootstrap generate --profile <profile> [--force]
# Generates the default script at $ORDINATOR_HOME/<profile>/bootstrap.sh and a blank bootstrap-secrets.env in the same directory, refuses to overwrite unless --force is given.

# ordinator bootstrap edit --profile <profile>
# Opens the script in $EDITOR, or prints an info message if not found.
```

**Summary Table:**

| Command                                 | Action/Output                                      |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ordinator bootstrap show --profile work | Print path to work profile script, or info if missing |
| ordinator bootstrap generate --profile work | Create default script and blank secrets file if missing |
| ordinator bootstrap edit --profile work  | Open script in $EDITOR, or info if missing         |

### Example: Profile-Specific bootstrap.sh Script

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Ordinator Bootstrap Script for the 'work' profile
# This script is intended to be run manually after ordinator apply --profile work.
# Edit this file to add your custom setup logic (install plugins, configure tools, etc).
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
# This script will be committed to your Git repository in PLAINTEXT format.
# NEVER put secrets, API keys, passwords, or any sensitive information directly in this script.
# 
# Instead, store secrets in the encrypted bootstrap-secrets.env file (which is gitignored)
# and source it at runtime if needed (see example below).
#
# Examples of what NOT to put in this script:
# - API keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.)
# - Passwords or private keys
# - Database credentials
# - Any other sensitive information
#
# Examples of what IS safe to put in this script:
# - System configuration (defaults write, etc.)
# - Tool setup commands
# - Non-sensitive environment variables
# - Custom application configuration
# - Plugin installations for tools

### 5.2 Replication Script and Branch Detection

**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** 5.1
**Estimated Time:** 1 day
**Testable:** ‚úÖ

**Tasks:**
- [x] On `ordinator init`, generate a `replicate.sh` script at the root of the user's dotfiles repo.
- [x] In the generated README, add a one-liner using the main branch by default:
  ```bash
  bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/main/replicate.sh)
  ```
- [x] Add a note in the README: "If your repository uses a different default branch (e.g., master), update the one-liner to match your branch name."
- [x] Auto-detect the default branch name (using git2 or remote HEAD) for internal use (e.g., CLI output, onboarding messages, or advanced scripting).
- [x] Ensure the replicate.sh script uses the detected branch name for any internal git operations or URLs.
- [x] Document the rationale for using main by default and the branch detection logic for robustness.

**UX/Documentation:**
- [x] README always shows the main branch in the one-liner, with a clear note about updating for custom branch names.
- [x] CLI and onboarding output use the detected branch name for accuracy.
- [x] Users are never left with a broken one-liner due to branch mismatch.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
# README one-liner uses main branch by default:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/main/replicate.sh)

# README note:
# If your repository uses a different default branch (e.g., master), update the one-liner to match your branch name.

# Internally, replicate.sh and CLI output use the detected branch name for all git operations and URLs.

# If the branch cannot be detected, default to main and print a warning.
```

**Completion Statement:**
Phase 5.2 (Replication Script and Branch Detection) is complete. Ordinator now generates a replicate.sh script and updates the README and onboarding output to use the detected default branch for all replication and setup instructions. This ensures users always get a working one-liner and robust onboarding, regardless of their branch configuration.

## Testing Strategy üß™

### Unit Tests
- Each module should have comprehensive unit tests
- Mock external dependencies (Git, SOPS, file system)
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Use temporary directories and repositories
- Test cross-platform compatibility

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Fresh installation on macOS
- [ ] Profile switching
- [ ] Secrets encryption/decryption
- [ ] Bootstrap script execution
- [ ] System script generation
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

## Development Guidelines üìã

### For Each Chunk:
1. **Start with tests** - Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. **Implement incrementally** - Small, working pieces
3. **Test thoroughly** - Unit + integration tests
4. **Document changes** - Update README and examples
5. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples work correctly

### Definition of Done:
- Feature is implemented
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- Examples are provided
- Code is reviewed (if applicable)
- Feature is tested manually

### Onboarding Output Examples

**After a fresh init (no repo):**
```
Repository initialized successfully at /Users/you/.ordinator

Next steps:
  1. Review and customize your configuration:
       ordinator config edit
  2. Add files and secrets to track:
       ordinator add ~/.zshrc --profile work
       ordinator secrets add ~/.aws/credentials --profile work
  3. (Recommended) Create and edit a setup/bootstrap script for your environment:
       ordinator bootstrap generate
       ordinator bootstrap edit
     Or for a specific profile:
       ordinator bootstrap generate --profile work
       ordinator bootstrap edit --profile work
  4. Apply your configuration to set up your environment:
       ordinator apply --profile work
  5. (Optional) Commit and push your changes:
       ordinator commit -m "Initial setup"
       ordinator push

For more commands and help, run:
  ordinator --help
  ordinator COMMAND --help

```

**After repo replication (ordinator init <repo-url>):**
```
Repository cloned and initialized at /Users/you/.ordinator

Next steps:
  1. Apply your configuration to set up your environment (and set up your AGE key if prompted):
       ordinator apply --profile work
     (Ordinator will prompt you to generate or import your AGE key if secrets are present.)
  2. (Optional) Edit tracked files, profiles, or bootstrap scripts as needed:
       ordinator config edit
       ordinator bootstrap edit [--profile work]
  3. (Optional) Add new files or secrets to track:
       ordinator add ~/.vimrc --profile work
       ordinator secrets add ~/.aws/credentials --profile work
  4. (Optional) Commit and push any local changes:
       ordinator commit -m "Local customization"
       ordinator push

For more commands and help, run:
  ordinator --help
  ordinator COMMAND --help
